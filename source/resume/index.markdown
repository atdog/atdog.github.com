* ***Systematic Detection of Injection Vulnerability of Android application***: Mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, are designed to provide strong isolation across apps. An app must request permission to access user data or phone features, which requires the user to grant. Sandboxes isolate apps but do not validate external data read by each app. In addition, fine-grained permissions are used to sandbox apps to manage their access to shared data. This paper presents Shared Data Injection Attack. A malicious app injects carefully-designed content into shared data sources, such as address books, SMS messages, and photos. When another app reads this content without first checking, the app may leak its capabilities which the malicious app has not been granted. We demonstrate several attacks on top Android apps that each has more than 10 million installs, including making calls, sending SMS, and cross-site scripting. To help guard against this type of attacks, we recommend that developers program defensively and mobile platforms providing strong data type checking and data validation.
